README for C07 in CS 2505 Spring 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tarball you just extracted should contain three files:

   README               this file
   gradec07.sh          grading script we will use to test your submission
   c07Files.tar         tar file containing test script/log/gis files:
		compare           tool to compare your logs to the reference logs
		gisdata/          directory containing GIS data files used by scripts
		   NM_1000.txt
		   NM_100.txt
		   NM_5000.txt
		logs/             reference logs produced from the scripts
		   reflog01.txt
		   reflog02.txt
		   reflog03.txt
		   reflog04.txt
		scripts/          test scripts
		   script01.txt
		   script02.txt
		   script03.txt
		   script04.txt

We suggest you do your development work in a different directory than where you
unpacked this tar file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the test files in your development work:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you have a working solution, or a partially-working solution, you can use
the supplied scripts and GIS files in your own testing.

Pick a script you want to use; we suggest that you start with script01.txt. 
Copy that script into the directory where you are developing your solution; read
the script to see what GIS data file it needs, and copy that file to the same
directory.

Run your solution:  gis scriptxx.txt logxx.txt  (xx is the number of the script)

Compare the results in your solution to the corresponding reference log, 
reflogxx.txt; you can do this manually, or you can use the compare tool:

	Invocation:  compare <test #> <reference log file> <student log file>
					 test # is the number of the test case being checked
					 reference log file is the name of the correct log file
					 student log file is the name of student's log file

(You can just use 1 for the <test #>.)  The compare tool will write its results
to a file named comparexx.txt, so you can examine that.

Using the grading script to verify your final submission:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use the grading script, prepare a tar file containing all the .c and .h
files needed by your solution AND NOTHING ELSE.  We recommend naming your
tar file using your PID; e.g., wmcquain.tar.

Execution options for the grading script:

   gradec07.sh <name of your tar file>
      Unpacks your tar file into ./tempdir
      Copies .c and .h files to ./build
      Tries to build an executable in ./build
      Runs your executable on each script in ./scripts
      Runs compare to score your log files vs the ones in ./logs
      Writes a summary of the testing to PID.txt
      
   gradec07.sh -clean
      Deletes all the files created by a previous run of the gradec02.sh
